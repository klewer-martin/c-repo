# Hello world!

This is a repository to store all my C files while i learn about this new language.

The examples and exercies are taken from the book "The C programming language" - written by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M. Ritchie, 
as well as my University workbook.

In "c-repo/src" you can find all the source codes.

Feel free to take a look.
