# Hello world!

This is a repository to store all my C files while I learn about this new language.

In src/ you can find modified source code taken from the book:
"The C programming language" - written by Brian W. Kernighan & Dennis M. Ritchie.

In "c-repo/95.11" you can find "Algoritmos y programacion I" (cod. 95.11) homework,
a subject from Facultad de Ingenieria de la Universidad de Buenos Aires.  

Please consider that I've never programmed in my life before more than blinking
a led with Arduino® lol.

Feel free to take a look.
